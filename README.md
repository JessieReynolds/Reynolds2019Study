Overview of Data Analysis for Reynolds Paper 

Brief study overview: 

Fathead minnow embryos (n=1400) were exposed to 8 concentrations of NAFC (2.5, 6.5, 10, 14.5, 21, 29.5, 40 and 54 mg/L) and one control (clean lake water) for 6 days. There were 3 replicates per treatment and about 45-50 embryos per replicate. There was nearly 100% mortality in the 29.5, 40, and 54 mg/L treatments during this phase, so these treatments were not included in the larval phase of the experiment. 

Once hatched, fish larvae (n= 450) were removed from exposure and transferred into outdoor mesocosms filled with clean lake water and raised for one month. Before transfer, embryonic replicates were pooled for each treatment and then separated into three new replicates for the larval stage to keep numbers consistent between replicates (Meaning larval replicates are not representative of embryonic replicates). There were between 17-30 fish per replicate.  

There are 16 endpoints that we looked at in this study: 

Embryonic endpoints: 

Embryo mortality  

Embryo hatch viability 

Embryo malformations 

Embryo heart rate 

Embryo twitches 

Embryo dry mass  

Larval endpoints: 

Larval mortality 

Larval growth: 

Wet mass  

Length 

Condition factor 

Larval behaviour: 

Burst events (before addition of food stimulus) 

Time spent swimming (before addition of food stimulus) 

Time spent in the middle (before addition of food stimulus) 

Burst events (after addition of food stimulus) 

Time spent swimming (after addition of food stimulus) 

Time spent in the middle (after addition of food stimulus) 

Hypotheses: 

H1: Embryonic exposure to NAFCs impairs cardiovascular development in fish, thereby reducing embryo survival and hatching success, and increasing incidences of cardiac malformations.  

H2: Impaired development due to embryonic NAFC exposure has sublethal effects that persist into later life stages, including decreased larval survival and growth, and altered larval behaviour.  

H3: Embryonic endpoints following NAFC exposure predict larval outcomes, including changes in mortality and activity.
